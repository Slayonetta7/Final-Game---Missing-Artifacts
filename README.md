Sound files:

The Secret sound when picking up an artifact, the "Aha" sound when collecting Gems and the background music were taken from Tomb Raider 3.

Code: 

Code relating to how to implement sound files was taken from the Unity documentation. 
The code for the health system was written by myself, following the same patterns of code we learned in class. 

Development Process:

I created the whole level by myself in Pro-Builder, including the Labyrinth, Hedges, Tower and Underground Area.
The fences, lamps, rocks and stones and other props such as gems and artifacts were sourced from the Unity asset store. 
I made use of the scripts we learned in class to create different pick-ups and enemies that patrol the area and follow Lara if she gets too close to them.
These scripts were modified to fit to my game, for example I added a health system which had to be applied in the Game Manager and the enemy scripts.
I also added sound files that are played when an item is picked up as well as background music.
I created a Win pop-up after collecting all three artifacts hidden throughout the maze and a Fail screen that pops up when Lara's health reaches zero at which point her model gets "destroyed".
A brief introduction text in the spawn area gives players context for the game as well as the goal to retrieve the three hidden artifacts.

The recording of the YouTube playthrough was very laggy as my Laptop was close to breaking down running the game and recording it at the same time.
The frame rate suffered which made it difficult to control Lara precisely and thus leads to some weird looking scenes in the recording.
I hope you'll be able to run the game on your machine to experience it in a fluid way!

The game can be played in the scene "Final Game", previous scenes with the name "Missing" are back-ups from the development process.

Weekly Exercises: 

I have four Weekly Exercise scenes, each relating to one of the YouTube tutorials from the playlist and featuring the things we covered in each tutorial.
